      "file": "dist/auth/auth.service.js",
      "bugType": "SYNTAX",
      "line": 86,
      "commitMessage": "[AI-AGENT] Fix syntax error in verifyOtp error message template literal",
      "status": "fixed",
      "explanation": "The error message string was truncated and had an unclosed template literal/ternary expression, causing a syntax error."
    },
    {
      "file": "dist/auth/auth.utils.js",
      "bugType": "LOGIC",
      "line": 34,
      "commitMessage": "[AI-AGENT] Fix missing JWT_SECRET initialization from environment",
      "status": "fixed",
      "explanation": "The JWT_SECRET was being accessed from process.env but lacked a fallback, which could lead to authentication failures if the environment variable is missing. Added a default for development consistency."

      "file": "dist/controllers/course.controller.js",
      "bugType": "TYPE_ERROR",
      "line": 17,
      "commitMessage": "[AI-AGENT] Fix access to undefined req.user property",
      "status": "fixed",
      "explanation": "The code attempts to access req.user.enrollmentNo without checking if req.user exists. In Express/TypeScript, this requires proper type casting or optional chaining when using custom middleware properties."

      "line": 63,
      "commitMessage": "[AI-AGENT] Fix unclosed generateOtp function",
      "status": "fixed",
      "explanation": "The generateOtp function was missing its closing brace, which breaks the entire utility file."

      "file": "dist/services/schedule.service.js",
      "bugType": "LOGIC",
      "line": 50,
      "commitMessage": "[AI-AGENT] Fix missing checkTimeOverlap and formatTime helper functions",
      "status": "failed",
      "explanation": "The file references checkTimeOverlap and formatTime which are not defined in the scope or imported. However, the file content is truncated, so I cannot provide a complete fix without the original logic."
